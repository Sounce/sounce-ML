# Real-time sign language recognition

Sign Languages are a set of languages that use predefined actions and movements to convey a message. These languages are primarily developed to aid deaf and other verbally challenged people. They use a simultaneous and precise combination of movement of hands, orientation of hands, hand shapes etc. Different regions have different sign languages like American Sign Language, Russian Sign Language etc. We focus on American Sign language in this project.
